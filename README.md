# Deep Learning with CNN

EC601 project #2

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python Version: 3<br>
Packages needed: tensorflow // tflearn<br>
To save your time, you can also download the trained model at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hxrbCUVFrJHpfl4fa4AwTpsr23k0iAgP<br>
The size of this model is beyond GitHub 100MB limit, so I can't upload it here.

## Running the tests

If you want to test the training part: Please run the train_save_CNN() funtion in my code<br>
if you are using a computer without GPU, you may want to delete line 50 and line 51.<br>
<br>
If you have downloaded the trained model from the link provided above, you are ready to the testing and predicting part.<br>
The testing image sunflower.jpg is provided. If you want to try any other images, please change the file name in line 77.

### Break down into end to end tests

For those who want to use the model in their own code. Please download the model and .py file, then import CNN_AlexNet into the heading part of your code.
